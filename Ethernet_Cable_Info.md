# Understanding Ethernet Cable Colors & Speeds

## 🚫 Ethernet Cable Color Does *Not* Determine Speed

Ethernet cable **colors do NOT affect performance, speed, or bandwidth**.  
Colors are used **only for organization and labeling**, mainly in IT environments.

---

## ✅ Do Different Ethernet Cable Colors Represent Different Speeds?

**No.**  
Cable color has **no technical meaning** and **does not impact performance**.

IT teams choose colors for easier cable management, such as:

- Identifying different networks (e.g., Production vs Testing)
- Separating voice/data/VLANs
- Reducing confusion in racks and patch panels

### Common (non-standard) color conventions:

| Color | Typical Usage (Custom Practice) |
|-------|---------------------------------|
| **Blue** | General data connections |
| **Yellow** | PoE (Power over Ethernet) |
| **Red** | Secure networks / DMZ |
| **Green** | Management interfaces |

> 🔹 These are **organizational choices**, not industry standards.

## ✅ What Actually Determines Speed?

The **Ethernet cable category** (Cat5, Cat6, Cat6a, etc.) determines speed —  
**NOT the color**.

## 📊 Ethernet Cable Categories & Their Speeds

| Cable Type | Max Speed | Max Distance |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Cat5**   | 100 Mbps | 100 m |
| **Cat5e**  | 1 Gbps | 100 m |
| **Cat6**   | 1 Gbps (up to 10 Gbps for short runs) | 55–100 m |
| **Cat6a**  | 10 Gbps | 100 m |
| **Cat7 / Cat8** | 10–40 Gbps | Short lengths |

---

## 🟩 Summary

- **Color = Only for labeling**
- **Category = Determines speed**
- Choose the cable **type**, not the **color**, for high-speed networking.
